How to unit test a function. Based on (https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/write-function-based-unit-tests-.html)

I (matlab) have written a function which solves quadratic equations, it's called:
	quadraticSolver.m

How do I know that it actually works though? Unit testing.
The tests are written in the testfile:
	tests/quadraticSolver_test.m

TESTFILES:
Function testfiles comprise of a series of functions, the first function is always

function tests = functionName_test
addpath(genpath("PathToFunction")) 
tests = functiontests(localfunctions); %This accesses all of the test functions local to this script.
end

After this come the unit tests, all unit test functions MUST start with "test":

function test_1(testCase)
actSolution = function(sample_input);
expSolution = expected_output;
verifyEqual(testCase,actSolution,expSolution)
end


RUN THE TESTS:
To run the tests go to the testfile and either type:
	runtests('quadraticSolver_test.m')
or press the Run Tests the button in the Editor tab of the IDE
